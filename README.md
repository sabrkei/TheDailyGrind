# The-Daily-Grind---HTML-CSS
First lab project showing practical skills I'd learnt in HTML and CSS after approximately 4 weeks.
Project requirments are outlined in REQUIREMENTS.MD

Project folder with all HTML , CSS and Image and Video files have been uploaded as "TheDailyGrind.zip". Alternatively, a live link is still active @http://ithsundervisning.se/public_html/feu25g/Scott_Abraham_Keinstrom/.

Content and sources used for my website:

All images used were downloaded with a trial license from Adobe Stock. For the video, an overlay was used to add transparency directly onto the video file, since I couldn’t figure out how to add transparency to the embedded video without using JavaScript — hopefully, I’ll understand this better later in the course.

The logo was created by me using Canva.

The sections “About us,” “Our Monthly Offer,” “Reviews,” and the address are all example texts written by ChatGPT.

Websites I used as source material, in addition to Avancera: w3schools, MDN Web Docs, Medium articles.
